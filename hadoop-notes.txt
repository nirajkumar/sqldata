1. Core Hadoop Components
	a)  Hadoop Common-
	b) Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) 
	c)MapReduce- Distributed Data Processing Framework of Apache Hadoop
	c)YARN 
2.	Data Access Components of Hadoop Ecosystem
	a)PIG
	b)Hive : data warehouse built on top of Hadoop an
		Hive simplifies Hadoop at Facebook with the execution of 7500+ Hive jobs daily for Ad-hoc analysis, reporting and machine learning.
3.	Data Integration Components of Hadoop Ecosystem- Sqoop and Flume
	a)Sqoop
	b)Flume
4.	Data Storage Component of Hadoop Ecosystem

	a) HBase : HBase is a column-oriented database that uses HDFS for underlying storage of data. HBase supports random reads and also batch computations using MapReduce. 
		With HBase NoSQL database enterprise can create large tables with millions of rows and columns on hardware machine. 
		The best practice to use HBase is when there is a requirement for random ‘read or write’ access to big datasets.
		Facebook is one the largest users of HBase with its messaging platform built on top of HBase in 2010.
		HBase is also used by Facebook for streaming data analysis, internal monitoring system, Nearby Friends Feature, Search Indexing and scraping data for their internal data warehouses.
			
	b) Accumulo
	c)Cassandra
5.	Monitoring, Management and Orchestration Components of Hadoop Ecosystem
	a)Oozie : Oozie is a workflow scheduler where the workflows are expressed as Directed Acyclic Graphs. 
	b)Zookeeper : Found by Elastic uses Zookeeper comprehensively for resource allocation, leader election, high priority notifications and discovery.
